# ngx-speech-recognition-btgwjy

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-speech-recognition-btgwjy)

need to refactor the code:
need to check if removing listerner in input is possible
need to move the command handler to a factory
need to move some generic function to a helper class
maybe we can move some repeated listener stuff to base
I have added TODO on those and other code too, need to check those after all the changes are done.
