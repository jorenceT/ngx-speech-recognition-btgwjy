# ngx-speech-recognition-btgwjy

[Edit on StackBlitz ⚡️](https://stackblitz.com/edit/ngx-speech-recognition-btgwjy)

need to refactor the code:
I have added TODO on those and other code too, need to check those after all the changes are done.
Mic listnering
combobox
moving enum to another file
change interface file name
spelling mistake commentHandler
need to remove current data index and indexOfCorrectData insted going to use the data itself

ignore list:
need to check if removing listerner in input is possible
need to move the command handler to a factory
